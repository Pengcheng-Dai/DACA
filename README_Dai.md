# Networked Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning: robot swarmâ€™s path planning

This repository contains the code for the numerical experiments in the manuscript "*Distributed Actor-Critic Algorithms for Global Convergence of Networked Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning*."</br>



## Code structure:

- 'trafficEnv.py': The multi-agent MDP environment of the traffic game.
- 'trafficAgent.py': Simulate the behavior of each agent.
- 'learningAgent.py': Contain decentralized algorithms for learning and centralized algorithms for evaluation.
